## Background

*"I should've died a very long time ago. Yet I am still here, to find and fulfill a purpose unbeknownst to me. Most people in life never get the time to find their purpose, so what is supposed to be mine, after having lived for millennia? What's the point in watching people you care about fade away from your life? Is there a point to watch the world move forward, as I stand still, stuck in time? I say: there is none. I will find a way to re-enter the cycle of life and death, by any means necessary."*

### Physical Combat

Before Ren came to the [[Stalwryn Kingdom]], he used to sport a **double-ended glaive** cobbled together with rudimentary materials such as sharpened stone and wood. Even with such primitive materials, Arzen was unusually adept with the weapon, and has proven to us his hunting skills. By [[Leoris Varens|King Varens]]' order, the finest blacksmith forged a much stronger version of Arzen's glaive, made with lightest and sharpest steel combined with a more practical grip infused with elven magicks. This version allows Ren to split the glaive in half, and dual-wield two longswords.

Despite this, however, Arzen refused to use the new glaive, instead opting to learn the **way of the sword and shield**. While we had no comment from the boy himself, [[Saria Pulse|Saria]] tells us it's because Arzen wanted repay the debt he owes to the King for saving him. Coincidentally, it is for the very same reason that Saria pursues the path of a lancer vanguard. She notes, however, that there may be a time where Arzen's time as a knight would come to an end, and the debt to the King be fulfilled. When that time comes, Arzen may return to using the glaive and continue his journey outside the Kingdom.

Arzen was passed down the remaining remnants of the [[Protean Concepts#The Paragon|Paragon]] through King Varens, and thus was made its Avatar. Its power had manifested such that it bestowed Arzen complete mastery over his body, allowing it to use even the most taxing of magicks. Naturally, this power also gives Arzen access to the most powerful defensive magicks. Our scholars still do not know why Arzen had developed such blessings from being the Paragon's Avatar, though we can only guess that something from his past triggered this extreme change.

During his time with the knights, Arzen wears a stripped-down version of the elite knight's armor, opting for more maneuverability and flexibility in combat. The elite knight's armor, for reference, is constructed using **caladonic steel** with varying layers of metal plates. Despite this, the armor molds to the shape of the wearer. Arzen also uses a darkened steel longsword and a darkened steel shield laced with magicks that bear striking similarity with that of the [[Protean Concepts#The Stargazer|Stargazer]]. He mostly uses the magic within to materialize the sword and shield out of nowhere, as if wishing it into existence. With both the Paragon's power and our rigorous knight training, Arzen proves a formidable warrior with his offensive and defensive capabilities.


### Magical Combat

Arzen's magicks are on levels never before seen by those chosen by the Paragon. Boasting both offensive and defensive magicks, Arzen's arsenal trumps all those who call themselves mages in the current era. Below are Arzen's currently known spells:

#### Obsidian Might

Tapping into the *Root of Earth*, Arzen is able to manifest and control extremely durable **blackstone** shards, or **[[Catalog of Materials#Obsidian|obsidian]]** in alchemist terms. Obsidian is normally a very fragile and brittle material, only used in crafting accessories and certain sharp weapons. However, through the Paragon's power, Arzen is able to draw, from the Root of Earth, the extremely durable properties of **[[Catalog of Materials#Caladon|caladon]]**, and infuse it into the obsidian, creating a material that is both virtually unbreakable and dangerously sharp.

#### Soul Discernment

While this source is, at best, unreliable, we must nevertheless document it. Arzen tells us that he is able to *"sense"* the souls near him. How he describes it is that, by being near other people, he is able to sense not only their presence, but ascertain their identity. This would be, in no doubt, useful as a tool for surveillance.

We believe that this is his supposed *Gift of the Realm* that was supposed to be passed on to the late prince [[Karos Varens]]. It would naturally explain the otherworldliness of this ability, as well as his unnatural instinct to 

> *// K.M. edit //*  
> This power goes even beyond living beings with a soul. It also allows Arzen to see souls of the deceased that cling onto the realm of the living. This corroborates with the fact that he personally knows *Karos* without, seemingly, ever meeting him.
> 
> This also corroborates his once-deteriorating mental state, as Arzen frequently came face-to-face with souls of the past, however vague or detailed he may remember them.

#### Spiritbonding

#### Wish of Existence

#### Sea of Flames

> *// K.M. edit //*  
> A terrifying invocation that has been discovered sifting through ancient texts, especially ones concerning **the Stargazer**. In it shows a very vague illustration of the Stargazer and a scenery full of flames, along with rocks falling from the heavens. That Arzen is able to use it shows extreme mastery over magic, but is also worrying.
> 
> When invoked, the sky darkens as flaming meteors pierce the clouds, and crashes onto the earth. Even with the destructive nature of this spell, Arzen consciously contains the spell to a certain, specified area. This invocation leaves the caster drained and exhausted, and Arzen is no exception. This one fact means that the spell duration would be very short, though that time linearly goes up as the reserves of the caster's mana increases.
> 
> How did the Stalwryn Kingdom, with all their extensive testing, miss this? It clearly shows Arzen having an unusual amount of essence stemming from the Stargazer! But how? Is Arzen also an Avatar of the Stargazer? He doesn't even seem to be aware of this fact...
