*Wanted Poster by the Congregation of Justice, Luxor Citadel*

## WARNING

The **Ascendant Slayer** is a dangerous criminal across [[Luciradis]], known for their murders of multiple known Ascendants, and the reported usage of their Concept's powers. Their goal for doing this is currently unknown, but know that this individual only attacks known Ascendants.

Should anyone suspect that they came across the **Ascendant Slayer**, do not be alarmed if you are not an Ascendant. Report to the nearest Citadel patrolman of their whereabouts. If you are an Ascendant that is reading this by chance, flee immediately to the Congregation of Justice and we shall handle the situation from there.

*Report by the Congregation of Justice, Luxor Citadel*

The [[Stalwryn Kingdom]] is preparing to hold their annual **Scarring Festival**. As you might know, this festival aims to prepare each nation for combat, and its main event is the mock battle between nations. All the nations are thus encouraged to participate, in order to better prepare their armies for combat. There are rumors surrounding the sudden appearance of a new and upcoming warrior, and people are claiming that this new warrior would be an Ascendant. We will continue to investigate this claim as the Scarring Festival draws closer.

Reports of the **Ascendant Slayer** have continued to decrease since the year **5263 ASC**. We have no traces of their whereabouts, or their actions since the last report. We still don't even know the identity of this killer. Nevertheless, we must stay vigilant in case any sign of them appears, so to enact quick and decisive judgement on this sinner.
