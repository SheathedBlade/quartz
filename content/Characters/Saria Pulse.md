## Background

*"'To taste freedom, spread your wings', is an ancient draconic proverb that I still believe applies to all life on Luciradis. To not be constrained by feelings of doubt and suffering. To not have your metaphorical wings be bound by those who seek to keep you grounded. To not let burdens hold you back from what you need to do. And should they need help, I'll pull them up, no matter how heavy their burdens are."*

Saria is the daughter of [[Factions of Luciradis#Brood of Arodraenix|Orsilus of Arodraenix]], the current draconic ruler of the skies taking root in the [[Grandiose Peaks]], and an unknown female human. Saria's mother still eludes us, however recent investigations confirmed her allegiance to [[Gensōkyo]], as there were reports of a dragon descending onto the [[Amber Clifftops]] multiple times. Regardless, hers and Orsilus's eloping birthed the first draconic half-breed in known existence.

>*// K.M. edit //*  
>As one might know, the draconic race are long-lived beings; where we, as humans, live for 100 years, the dragons may live for up to multiple millennia. In addition, despite of how ingrained the dragons are in our world, the aforementioned race is not of Luciradis, but from beyond the skies.
>
>Since the advent of Saria's peculiar birth, the population of dragon-human hybrids, now also known as **Vyrians**, have increased, though the lifespan of these individuals is much shorter than a regular dragon's. It is much closer to a human's lifespan, an average of 170 years.
>
>Saria is a special case; despite having a human-dominated appearance, she maintains a dragon's lifespan.

Saria is also the current Avatar of the [[Protean Concepts#The Shimmering Wings|Shimmering Wings]], though she received them not by choice. This power was bestowed to her by her father (who was the previous Avatar) as part of a traditional ritual, which involves completing a trial in order to receive the powers of the Shimmering Wings. After the completion of the trial, and the ritual thereafter, the thought of carrying the burden of this immense power proved too much for her, as she ran away from her home at a very young age.

She was found by [[Arzen Lynos]] near the outskirts of the [[Port of Anahymn]], where Ren had saved her from Arodraenix pursuers, hiding away within the human-populated port city. On Saria's account, the time they left the port city to the [[Stalwryn Kingdom]] was approximately 6 weeks, during of which the two had to gather their own food and amenities due to having no money.

Upon reaching the Stalwryn Kingdom and living in many different inns, her and Ren Lynos were involved in an altercation with some of the patrolling knights. The reports say the knights expressed extreme discomfort and prejudice towards Saria and her unknown origins, while Ren Lynos defended her and assaulted the knights. Normally, this would incur massive penalties, but through the good graces of King [[Leoris Varens]], not only were Saria and Ren spared, but they were also given financial support personally funded by the king. Using this support, they would buy a property within the walls of the Stalwryn Kingdom and build up a popular eatery called **[[Stalwryn Kingdom#The Campfire|"The Campfire"]]**.

Feeling that they owed King Varens for turning their lives around, Saria and Ren both applied to be knights. Through her precise and aggressive spear combat, Saria quickly rose through the ranks to become **the leader** of the vanguard unit.

> *// K.M. edit //*  
> Since the fall of the Stalwryn Kingdom, Saria dropped her title of Lead Vanguard. King Varens expressed interest in relieving both Saria's and Ren's duties as knights out of respect for their yearning to explore the world.

Curiously, Saria chose not to input her family's name as her last name. When filling out paperwork for her application to the royal knights, she was conflicted as to whether or not to include the name she loathed so much. Ultimately, Saria decides not to associate herself with her previous family, and tells us she wanted a name to symbolize the companionship between her and Ren in their journey together. In addition, her chosen name would fit quite well with her enhanced hearing of heartbeats through the Concept of the Shimmering Wings. Thus, she put "Pulse" as her last name.

> *// K.M. edit //*  
> Keen on reigniting her love of exploring the unknown (a dream that was shared with Ren), she took to the cosmos at some indefinite point in time, exploring different worlds and meeting new people. Shortly after the start of the conflict with the Stargazer, she would return to aid in the battle.

## Appearance

![[saria-refsheet.webp]]
*Credit: @8Ovjfg8YRwM7qXz*  

Saria, as a daughter to the dragons, has very noticeable draconic features, including her pitch-black scales covering small portions of her pale skin. In addition, black horns protrude from the top of her head, with a tail reaching the length of her legs. Despite this, however, she takes on a human-dominated appearance. Saria has long, flowing platinum blonde hair with natural red highlights, along with teal eyes.

Saria has an athletic build, no doubt due to her training as a vanguard. Her bust size is F/G (US/JP), so she does have a slightly voluptuous and curvy appearance. She bears a love crest near her abdominal area, which Saria tells us it's as proof of her and [[Arzen Lynos|Arzen's]] affection and love for each other.

>*// K.M. edit //*  
>Although multiple millennia have passed, Saria still retains her youthful, mid-to-late 20's human form. Whether this is a byproduct of being a hybrid or through careful maintenance is up in the air. This kind of thing is extremely personal to her, so I won't pry further.

Through her Transformation, Saria becomes a dragon of formidable size, with a wingspan of **60 meters (or approximately 197 feet)**. The black scales present on her human form are also present on the underside of the dragon, however its sleek appearance pales in comparison to the blindingly white scales on the rest of her body, which cover everything but the underside.

As an Avatar of the Shimmering Wings, Saria's wings are appropriately violet in color, just as the legends of the Concept were depicted. When she invokes the Shimmering Call, the wings turn from violet to golden, and Saria assumes a position such that the wings can be easily seen.

>*// K.M. edit //*  
>In the current era, Saria sports her vanguard outfit as it's considered fashionably acceptable in Nova Ciel, and it's the most comfortable fit for her. This outfit could also easily double as a formal outfit in certain events. Although she likes to change things up in terms of her appearance, she falls back onto this specific outfit if she feels indecisive.

## Personality

Saria is generally a carefree, compassionate, and polite person, traits in which have only become more apparent during her residency in the Stalwryn Kingdom. She's very approachable and cheeky, but blunt, and doesn't beat around the bush. She naturally draws a lot of attention to herself, despite not liking the amount of attention she receives.

In matters of importance, such as military training, she becomes very serious and takes up a no-nonsense attitude. As the leader of Stalwryn's vanguard units, she is a natural at taking command and responsibility, and makes sure her comrades perform the best they can be.

Saria is also very dismissive of affairs concerning her departure of the Arodraenix family, as she doesn't want to hold onto past affairs that no longer matter to her.

>*// K.M. edit //*  
>Saria used to be an upbeat and carefree person during the years before the fall of the Stalwryn Kingdom. However, throughout the thousands of years she has lived, she lost her carefree personality, and in its place, gained a more serious and jaded one. After seeing every calamity, and the tragedies that were wrought in its wake, she tries to uphold a positive outlook as she keeps moving forward in spite of them.
>
>Since the conflict with the Stargazer, she seems to have regained a little bit of her carefree personality back, as she tries to partake in the small, daily-life activities that a person born in Nova Ciel would also partake, such as going out to restaurants and cafés, meeting up with friends, and indulging in her hobbies (of which cooking is the most prominent).

### Likes

- Gourmet food
	- She loves making and eating these foods, as some of her cooking skills were passed on by Arzen during their stay in the Stalwryn Kingdom.
- Trendy fashion
	- She rarely gets extremely elegant outfits, but she will always keep up with fashion trends such as streetwear, casual wear, and techwear.
- Exploring
	- She loves to explore the obscure and the unknown, which is a trait shared with Arzen Lynos. Though, she enjoys the journey more than the destination.

### Dislikes

- Self-hating individuals
  - She thinks that they take life for granted, and that they are being extremely short-sighted and close-minded, ignorant of the effects they have on others close to them.
- Loneliness
  - She hates to part with people that she knows live shorter lives than her, but in reality, she fears travelling alone. She fears that there would be no one to share pleasantries with, no one to die with, no one to be there to lift her up when she can't do it herself.

## Expertise

### Physical Combat

Saria uses a swordspear infused with her innate draconic energy. As part of her training as a Kingdom vanguard, Saria uses various lance techniques taught by the most veteran of soldiers, as well as incorporating a unique style taught by [[Arzen Lynos|Arzen]] throughout their travels. The swordspear is a weapon granted to higher-ranking soldiers once they have bested their masters. Saria's swordspear was then modified to house a portion of her draconic magicks, covering the blade in a violet flame hot enough to sear meat in only a few seconds.

Saria also wields the primal instinct of [[Protean Concepts#The Shimmering Wings|the Shimmering Wings]]. By tapping into that power, she gains immense agility and strength. While half-breeds tend to struggle to transform into their more pure-primal counterparts, Saria uses the Concept's power to not only easily grant her human form flight via ethereal wings, but also allow her to transform into her fully-fledged draconic form for an extended period of time.

As a vanguard, Saria opted for speed and maneuverability, and thus have taken off the metallic pieces of her outfit and fought with the cloth uniform underneath. This works to her advantage, however, as the rallying power of the Shimmering Wings relies on the user standing out from a crowd. Her bright white uniform is a stark contrast to the gray metal plates of standard-issue armor, allowing more attention onto her.

### Magical Combat

As for her magic capabilities, Saria is slightly above average amongst the invokers within our ranks, though this is in fact due to her affinity to the Concept. Below are her most used spells and abilities:

#### Violet Flames

This spell is an enhanced version of the basic "Create: Fire" invocation, the difference being that Saria has imbued her draconic essence into these flames, giving it a violet hue. These flames can augment various areas of her combatting skills. Most notably, Saria uses it to enshroud her swordspear's edge in violet flames, allowing her to sear her enemies while slicing through them. In addition, Saria can conjure up ethereal wings, granting her immense speed and the ability to fly. As it is a branch of the Fire invocation, this invocation proves to be very versatile and flexible, and can almost be used in any situation.

#### Shimmering Call

Shimmering Call is a spell reserved for the Avatar of the Shimmering Wings, as it allows Saria to give a rallying call to her allies, boosting morale and giving them strength and endurance. The range of Saria's call in her human form reaches up to a small township sector, with the area of the [[Port of Anahymn]] as an example of the extent of her range.

#### Transformation - Draconic Ascension

Saria's Transformation allows her to grow into a dragon of considerable size, towering over our castle walls with ease. In this state, Saria forgoes her lance in favor of her claws and flames. In this form, she commands the full might of the Shimmering Wings, enhancing the aforementioned invocations. Violet Flames serve to enhance her claws as well as her breath of fire. Shimmering Call noticeably increases in range, as her cry can be heard from several battalions.
