## Background

*"Listen, I may look positively brimming with joy, but I do worry about a lot of stuff in the back of my head. It's mostly about the future. I personally think it's crazy that Ferros elves never have to need to worry about this, because they're just conditioned to not care. It's the plight that the short-lived have to face every day. Well, as someone who interacts with the short-lived every day, it's hard not to empathize, or even identify, with them.*

*Every time I take to the road, I think about what's waiting for me when I arrive at my destination. Metaphorically, of course. Because as much as I'd like to enjoy the journey, not knowing what awaits me at the end scares me."*

Rietta was born into a family of merchants, a rare occupation for elves, but necessary nonetheless to facilitate trade inside and out of the isolated [[Ferros Republic]]. At the time of her birth, her parents were settled in the territory of the [[Stalwryn Kingdom]], specifically in the small village of [[Lyntoa Village|Lyntoa]]. She grew up as a mischievous child, always getting involved with antics with the other children in the village, much to the dismay of the elders.

At the age of 14, Rietta and her parents temporarily relocated from Lyntoa Village to the Stalwryn Kingdom proper. It is during her stay inside the walls of the Stalwryn Kingdom that she developed a passion for not only business, but also alchemy. In her free time, Rietta likes to stay at the local apothecary, where individuals blessed with the powers of the [[Protean Concepts#The Convergence|Convergence]] do their best work. Here, she became an apprentice to an alchemist, seeking to indulge in her passion. Because of the nature of the craftsmanship of standard-issue Stalwryn weaponry and armor, the apothecary and the forge often worked together, which meant Rietta often had access to both facilities.

At the end of her apprenticeship, as a token to herself, Rietta commissioned the head blacksmith, {blacksmith name here}, for a firearm in which she can use her alchemical solutions to infuse the projectiles with special properties. The smith graciously accepted her request, and crafted a potent, long-range firearm that gives room for Rietta's alchemical compounds to infuse the bullets before leaving the barrel. This, though, was given as a gift, free of charge, to Rietta upon her graduation from being an apprentice.

>*// K.M. edit //*  
>What Rietta had received is a weapon that is now known as a **semi-automatic rifle** in Nova Ciel. There are compartments in which she can insert containers filled with alchemical solutions, which allows her to fire bullets infused with the solutions to inflict various effects on her target.

It is also at this time where our physicians have confirmed the **protean essence** of Rietta, confirming her status as an Avatar of the [[Protean Concepts#The Navigator|Navigator]]. For personal reasons, Rietta's parents requested this information be private until they, as a family, arrive back to the Ferros Republic. It is understandable, however, given the structure of society within the Republic. The class structure allows for those who are officially identified as Avatars of the Navigator to be instantly given the status of **sovereign elves**. It would be a boon for this family, as they started out as **industrious elves**. As such, the quality of life afforded to sovereign elves would immensely help the family in terms of financial status and influence as merchants.
## Appearance

Rietta is a young girl with pointed ears and fair skin. She also has a slender frame, which is not unexpected of someone whose job is to foray and gather materials in the wild. Her bust size is measured to be D/E (US/JP). One can expect her youthful appearance to stay consistent, as elves tend to retain their young adult look up until they reach the last quarter of their lifespans. Generally, an elf's total lifespan is an average of 8000 years.

Rietta has long, **caramel-colored hair**, with side bangs reaching to her shoulders. She usually ties her hair in a ponytail, but without it, the ends of her hair reaches all the way down her back. Rietta also has amber eyes, a trait inherited from her mother. Rietta has matching headpieces that she attaches near both of her ears, which give her a more whimsical look.

Rietta mainly dons her comfortable alchemist outfit, which consists of {torso clothing I know there's a lab coat-esque aesthetic with a vest}, **black, tight-fitting shorts** with **sheer tights** underneath, and {I'll have to think about boots}. For her work, she does carry around her **owl horn-rimmed glasses**, with a black frame with golden metal engravings. Rietta only uses her glasses for precise alchemical work.

She is often seen with alchemical gadgets and concoctions, though a fairly recent addition to her arsenal is a very unique firearm that utilizes her alchemical compounds. The firearm dismantles into three parts for portability, and it can easily be put back together for a combat situation. She commonly stores the weapon into a inconspicuous bag, along with reserves of ammunition, in the form of steel bullets, and dangerous alchemical solutions that coat the bullet to give it special effects.

>*// K.M. edit //*  
>While her alchemist outfit is her most commonly used one, Rietta often changes outfits in accordance to popular trends in Terystal, particularly dressing in fashion styles such as casual wear, formal wear, and cutesy clothing.

## Personality

Rietta is a cheerful and playful person, always looking to lighten the mood out of any situation. She would often play with her schoolmates when she was younger, and makes herself very friendly and approachable to everyone. She is, however, very smart compared to others her age, which often makes Rietta a target of adoration and jealousy.

When it comes down to business, however, Rietta is very crafty and cunning, honed through her experience as a traveling merchant. While she is fair and negotiable to individual clients, for much bigger entities, she will try to squeeze as much value and money from her business partners as possible, while also maintaining goodwill with them. All the while, Rietta maintains a friendly façade as she is negotiating.

>*// K.M. edit //*  
>Since the fall of Stalwryn to the Cicatri Emigration, Rietta still appeared as a friendly, naïve person that everyone recognized. But it's clear to anyone looking hard enough that she's using this as a front to hide her loneliness and depression of having lost those close to her in war. She rarely confided with anyone, not even those of whom she knew from centuries ago.
>
>Since [[Arzen Lynos|Ren's]] arrival to Terystal, and the subsequent [[Overgrowth Incident]], Rietta no longer hides her sadness with a mask of happiness, and lets her feelings come through to the forefront. It's almost as if life had refilled her body with renewed vigor. Rietta became more relaxed, opting to hang out with [[Iris Riedel]] and enjoying her life to the fullest.

### Likes

- Overpreparation
	- She is, to no surprise to many who know her, a worrywart, despite her carefree and reckless nature. As such, she likes to stock multiple reserves of ammunition and alchemical compounds just for the one rare moment that she'll need to use it. This does extend to some of her other activities, to some extent.
- Helping her local community with alchemy
	- When Rietta started traveling by herself, she often comes into contact with people who are in need of her alchemical services. While Rietta could charge money for her services, she ultimately decided for it to be free of charge, as her main source of income came from her occupation as a merchant. As alchemy allows for more custom-made solutions, Rietta naturally grew an audience that only comes to her for very specialized products and/or requests.
- Pop Culture *// K.M. edit //*
	- A relatively new passion from when Rietta settled into Terystal. The emergence of pop culture, such as more daring types of music, clothing, and entertainment, has her enamored. During her work, she would be seen constantly on gaming websites, video platforms, and clothing shops.

### Dislikes

- Pointless violence/fighting
	- Rietta is very pacifist, but will fight when no other option is available to her. She often tries to diffuse the situation first, at any cost.
- Recreational drinking
	- Rietta would rather be the responsible, sober person in the room. 
- Being challenged on her intelligence
	- This doesn't happen often with those she is close to, but with business entities that she is negotiating with. As an experienced merchant, Rietta knows when she is being used or scammed, and **will** call them out on it, either directly or indirectly through veiled financial ultimatums.

## Expertise

### Magical Combat

Rietta is very proficient at the manipulation of water, a trait an Avatar of the Navigator would surely possess. To further enhance her concentration of her invocations, she wields a custom-made staff from the [[Ferros Republic]], the domain of the elves. The below are some of her most notable invocations:
#### Scalding Flood
This spell combines the effects of the basic "Create: Fire" and "Create: Water" invocations and improves upon it, shooting out a flood of scalding brine water, burning the target in the process. Using this spell in particular is decently draining on the average user, but comes as naturally as breathing for Avatars of the Navigator.

#### Aquatic Veil
Rietta generates a barrier, made of water and shards of ice, that reflects any projectiles that come into contact with it. Objects that are already inside this barrier can be moved out of it, but the opposite doesn't occur, as objects trying to enter the barrier from the outside will be rejected. Constant attention to this invocation is key for an impenetrable barrier, but projectiles that hit the barrier will take a toll on the user's stamina.

#### Fluid Decoy
Rietta generates crude, watery decoys to distract the target, which can take on the appearance of anything from beasts to humanoids. In addition, Rietta can put a little more effort into making her decoys and generate copies of either people she knows well, or of herself. These decoys are particularly more dangerous, as they can use invocations (albeit at a lower intensity) and copy the mannerisms of the original very accurately.

### Alchemy

Despite being very talented as an invoker, Rietta opts for a more niche career: **alchemy**. As a curious and experimental individual, she likes the complexity that alchemy introduces. And there are benefits to pursuing this craft in general, one being that products made from alchemy are made in advance. This means that, in combat, there is no cost to her stamina for using these items, as she will have already spent the stamina needed to create the items in question.

Together with the abundant essence from the [[Protean Concepts#The Convergence|Convergence]] and the skills from being the Navigator's Avatar, she is able to concoct magical compounds through the precise handling of fluids, using very unique recipes unknown to the common alchemist. These compounds can vary from flammable fluids to corrosive compounds. Only Rietta knows the effects of each of her potions.

> *// K.M. edit //*  
> To supplement her knowledge of alchemy on the battlefield, Rietta uses her rifle in tandem with her alchemical compounds to produce bullets infused with various destructive properties, enabling her to be very versatile in any situation.
> 
> This does mean Rietta needs to carry not only ammunition, but also refills of the compounds she creates. Fortunately for her, the compounds are easy to make through her powers of the Convergence.
