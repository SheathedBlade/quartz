## Background

*"Isn't it the case that we want future generations to have better lives than those of their predecessors? Then, what I have done is simple, really. I strive for a future wherein those who come after us would put surviving as an afterthought. The path I have chosen to take would always be paved in ruin and tragedy.*

*My only regret is that you have chosen to shoulder my legacy as your burden. But, if you would consider all that I have done, for you or otherwise, sins, then I'll gladly be a sinner."*

Amara Illustros, previously Sister Amara Illustros, is an exiled traveling **beacon** of the [[Factions of Luciradis#Luxori Covenant|Luxori Covenant]], the prominent religious group of the [[Luxor Citadel]]. The nature of how she was exiled, however, is unbeknownst to us, as the Covenant refused to comment further on this topic. Thus, out of respect, only those of us in the know are aware of her existence and subsequent status of the Covenant.

The **Illustros** are a distinguished family within the Luxor Citadel, holding a high position within the ruling government, **particularly with affairs concerning Luxor's military strength**. It was to her father's disappointment when Amara cut all ties with her family after being exiled from the Luxori Covenant.

Amara, since being excommunicated, left Luxor Citadel and traveled the vast lands, all the while concealing her identity and putting up the façade of a Sister from the local church. What she has done during her traveling the world is unknown, but it can be assumed she visited most, if not all, landmarks, nations, and everything in between. After years of traveling, she eventually settled into [[Lyntoa Village]], becoming a caretaker for one of the families at the village.

## Appearance


## Personality


## Expertise

#### Physical Combat:

Amara wields a **double-ended glaive**, a unique weapon bestowed onto her as a high-ranking individual within the Luxori Covenant. She has, however, made modifications to her glaive ever since she was settled in [[Lyntoa Village]], attaching a "whip-like" modification on her blades. This gives her glaive the same sort of functionality a whipsword from the soldiers of the [[Gensōkyo]] has, wherein parts of metal from the blade is attached via a flexible cord that both expands and contracts.

Overall, this modification makes her glaive a very dangerous weapon to use, as one would need to have the skill required to use a glaive and a whipsword at the same time. However, at the same time, if used correctly, it is a deadly weapon to use against her foes. Amara herself rarely ever uses the modification, only deploying it when it is absolutely necessary.

## Confidential Information
*This is information newly discovered about Amara Illustros by the Cerelicia expedition team.*

Amara is revealed to be the last known Avatar of the elusive [[Protean Concepts#The Stargazer|Stargazer]]. This fact is known after the **Second Scarring** came to pass, where an expedition team, which included [[Arzen Lynos]], had traveled back to the [[Luciradis#Cicatri Ciel|Cicatri Ciel]] to survey the land that's long since abandoned. The Avatars of the expedition team dove down into the depths of the **Well of Dreams** in [[Lyntoa Village#Well of Dreams|Lyntoa Village]]. There, Amara reveals that she had used Ren to instinctively gather all the remnants of the Concepts in order to gain control and invoke the power of all the Concepts.

Additionally, Amara is also revealed as the identity of the [[The Remnant Slayer|Remnant Slayer]], the once infamous international criminal that roamed the world killing the Avatars in order to have all the Concept remnants in once place. Her goal is to reset [[Luciradis]] and rid the world of the power of the Concepts, as well as their influence, citing that she has seen the ugliness of the world she walked on and wished it to go away. Deciding it was enough, Amara awakened to her powers of the Stargazer, as both Amara and the Stargazer shared a common ideal: "Would the world be better off without the Concepts?".

During their meeting, Ren claims that Amara had the remnants of the [[Protean Concepts#The Harvester|Harvester]], [[Protean Concepts#The Convergence|Convergence]], and [[Protean Concepts#The Illuminator|Illuminator]] before forcibly obtaining the powers of the rest of the Concepts (except the [[Protean Concepts#The Paragon|Paragon]]). It's revealed then that Amara secretly gave Ren her Concept powers in order for Ren to win most of his most difficult battles.

We can infer here that Amara, after having been traveling as a **beacon** for the Luxori Covenant for so long, has had enough of the death and despair, the conspiracies and lies, juxtaposed with the "peace" that was prevalent in the world.

For the longest time, we had thought Amara had died after a failed ritual in [[Lyntoa Village]], sacrificing herself instead of **Ren**. Instead, her soul, backed by the essence of the Stargazer, essentially plugged the **Well of Dreams**, which made it functionally useless. Amara's soul was split, with her warm and caring personality being infused with [[Leoris Varens]], which would explain his sudden change in behavior. The obsessive part of her soul, which holds her desires of a world free of the influence of the Concepts, stayed within the **Well of Dreams**, eventually fusing with the Stargazer. Both parts of her soul, however, holds an unnatural sibling-like affection to Ren, with the desire for Ren to see the world beyond the village.

Thus, Amara was responsible for the curse of immortality placed on Ren. The reasoning for this was previously unknown, but after the **Second Scarring** came to pass, Amara revealed that she grew very close with the family that she was taking care of in [[Lyntoa Village]]. During that time, the family would eventually have a son that would turn out to be a miscarriage. Borrowing the power of the Stargazer, she willed Ren into existence, with the caveat being that he would be **immortal in all aspects so long as Amara exists in some form**. Since then, she had a sibling-like relationship with Ren, with Amara wanting to only show the beautiful side of the world, while hiding all its dark aspects.

Though her ambitions of resetting the world was ultimately stopped by the Neo Luxor expedition team, Amara's wish to rid the world of the influence of the Concepts was made reality by Ren. Thus, the power of the Concepts stop at the last remaining Avatars, and are never to be reawakened within another being. Now, fate and destiny belongs to the lowest denominator.
