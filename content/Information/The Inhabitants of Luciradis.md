# Humanoid Races
## Akumari

> "Akumaros" is the plural version of this word.

The akumaros are a rare race; not native to Cicatri Ciel, but from the southern lands beyond the horizon. They first immigrated to Cicatri Ciel, and set their roots down on what is now known today as the [[Gensōkasu]]. While the vast majority of its population is not of Akumari descent, pure Akumari individuals garner immense respect within their communities.

>*// K.M. edit //*  
>The ancestral homeplace of the akumaros is in the frigid mountains of **Gokan**, where the developed city of **[[Ifuri]]** takes root. Before the **Cicatri Emigration**, Ifuri was just one of many nomadic Akumari settlements. One could say an Ifurian akumari is much more traditional than those one would find at Gensōkasu.

The most defining physical characteristic of an Akumari is their pair of horns protruding from their head. While the style of horn can vary, this will always be the first thing anyone can use to identify an Akumari. Generally, the color of their horns stay consistent to darker tones, such as black, brown, and deep red.

The akumaros have a natural affinity to cold weather, their skin having been evolved to retain the individual's body heat as much as possible. Of course, extreme cold weather would require them to wear conventional winter gear, but chilly weather is not enough for an akumari to wear much more than a jacket.

## Elf

The elves are respecters of the natural order of Luciradis. Overly concerned with the maintenance of nature, the elves are inherently born with the ability to *"hear"* nature, and are only second to the [[The Inhabitants of Luciradis#Terrakin|Terrakin]] when it comes to utilizing invocations that draw power directly from the **Root of Earth**.

The elves are an introverted race, tending to keep to themselves in most public affairs. The majority of the elven population lies in [[Galaderyn]], a haven for elves situated in a dense prismaia forest on top of a mana-imbued lake. Only a few groups of elves venture outside of the haven, though it is made difficult to do so due to the intervention of the ruling sovereigns.

The ruling faction that the majority of elves associate with is the [[Factions of Luciradis#Ferros Republic|Ferros Republic]], a government run by a self-proclaimed "high societal class" of elves. For elves that do not fall under the aforementioned category, they are either lower-class citizens or are not a part of the republic. Thus, the existence of elves outside of their haven is uncommon at best.

## Human

## Luxori

> Luxori is both a singular and plural noun.

The Luxori are a race with powers descended from the Concept of the [[Protean Concepts#The Illuminator|Illuminator]]. Originally, these individuals were humans from the time before **the Scarring**, but with the Illuminator's magic, the humans that followed the Illuminator during the Scarring obtained a natural talent for light-based magic. This large community of humans would become the Luxori, beginning its roots on a landmass named after them: [[Luxor Citadel|Luxor]].

The appearance of a Luxori bears a striking resemblance to that of a human's, but the Luxori have **symmetrical dark markings** all over their torso and limbs, with some individuals being born with some markings on the face. This is a unique trait of the Luxori, an evolutionary development borne from subsequent generations of Luxori. These dark markings on the body enhances the powers of the Illuminator, **illuminating these dark markings up to a vibrant, golden color** whenever the Luxori individual would use light-based invocations. The intensity of the brightness of the color would depend on the strength of the invocation being cast.

## Terrakin

## Vyrian

> *// K.M. edit //*  
> This section has been added to reflect the current state of Luciradis's inhabitants.
> Related: [[#Dragon]]

Vyrians are a humanoid hybrid race descended from the dragons, claiming and recycling the original nomenclature **"Hryvernus"** for their own identification. Most Vyrians have appeared on [[Luciradis#Nova Ciel|Nova Ciel]], having migrated from [[Luciradis#Cicatri Ciel|Cicatri Ciel]] around 8000 ASC alongside most of the population of Cicatri Ciel.

Vyrians take on a human appearance, with draconic aspects sprinkled in. Namely, a Vyrian has the horns and the tail inherited from their parents at random. The color of its scales are randomly inherited from either of the parents. The skin scales are a trait only seen on the [[Saria Pulse|very first Vyrian]]. The Vyrians that have been born after her, when the idea became popularized, have no such scales on the skin. As such, Vyrians are often confused with [[#Akumari|Akumaros]], another horned race. The difference, however, is that Akumaros do not possess tails.

While the conception of a Vyrian from a pure dragon and human couple is still being researched, the conception of a Vyrian from Vyrian parents operates as how a humanoid race would conceive a child.

# Bestial Races

## Dragon

The dragons are an extraterrestrial, intelligent race of winged, scaled beasts. While these beasts weren't initially called as such, "dragon" is a term coined by the native inhabitants of Luciradis to describe the species in general. The original nomenclature of the dragons is still used within communities of dragons, however it is never used in conversation with other non-draconic inhabitants, deferring to "dragon" as the easier way to communicate.

> The original nomenclature, as one of our researchers found out, is "Hryvernus", or "Hryverni" as plural.

Of the existing dragons, there are several clans of dragons that exist, similar to tribes or nations. The most dominant clan is the Arodraenix clan, which is aptly named for the ancient dragon, Arodraenix, the Concept of the [[Protean Concepts#The Shimmering Wings|Shimmering Wings]]. This clan secludes itself on top of the [[Grandiose Peaks]], located on the western island of Cicatri Ciel (which is home to the [[Gensōkasu]]).
