## Metals
### Caladon

Caladon is the name of the natural material found in the aptly named **Caladon Valley**, and it is also the name of the explorer who first found the material. Caladon is extremely durable, making it extremely hard to mine. When mined, caladon comes in the form of a very white rock cluster, with very vague hues of viridian.
### Caladonic Steel

In the Stalwryn Kingdom, caladonic steel was first conceived by creating an **alloy** of caladon and iron, producing a material that was both **durable** and **lightweight**, making it extremely useful in the creation of armor. Caladon is extremely dense, so the creation process of caladonic steel would only require a small amount of molten caladon to reinforce the much more common material, iron.
