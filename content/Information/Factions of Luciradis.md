## Brood of Arodraenix
### Background

The Brood of Arodraenix refers to the ruling clan of dragons led by Broodmaster Orsilus of Arodraenix.

## Dreamweavers (Yumori-te)
### Background

The dreamweavers are one of two factions of **akumaros** descended from the protean concept, [[Protean Concepts#The Reflection|the Reflection]]. They are native to the southern landmass of [[Luciradis#Nova Ciel|Nova Ciel]], make up the majority of the nomadic akumaros, and are the ones who stayed behind while **the Reflection** and **the Illusionists** journeyed north to the landmass of [[Luciradis#Cicatri Ciel|Cicatri Ciel]].

## Ferros Republic

The society of the elves in the Ferros Republic can be broken down as thus: the **sovereign elves**, the **industrious elves**, and the **drifting elves**. These monikers are usually tied to the particular family of elves, making it difficult for elves to grow out of their titles. In rare circumstances, however, the status of an elf in the Ferros Republic can change with approval of the ruling sovereign elves.

> It is important to note that these are just titles given to elves. There are no physical/visual differences between the classes of elves in the Ferros Republic.

For elves that exist outside the allegiance of the Ferros Republic, these titles rarely matter to them, as it reeks of rigidity and tradition. Those that leave the Republic rarely ever are allowed back in, so elves that do leave take up residence in other nations.

### Sovereign Elf

The sovereign elves are a minority of elves enjoying the luxuries of being high-class individuals in other nations. They are often the ruling class of elves, dictating the path of the Republic as they see fit. They often take the role of advisors, academic mentors, and other privileged occupations.

The title of sovereign elf is a bit flexible, as the ruling party of sovereign elves can congregate and promote an individual to the status of sovereign elf. These are rare occasions, however, for the circumstances must be right in order to gain this status.
### Industrious Elf

An industrious elf is equivalent to a working class individual. They are not as well-read or educated as a sovereign elf, but they are needed for society to function at its core. Occupations such as smiths, farmers, and crafters are some of the many roles that industrious elves partake in.

Although the elves are discouraged from leaving Galaderyn, the sovereign elves have deemed **merchants** as a necessary occupation in order to maintain the Republic's economy. Therefore, only a very small subset of industrious elves become merchants and they are allowed to come in and out of the Republic with official travel documentation.
### Drifting Elf

Drifting elves are, for a lack of a better term, exiled from the Ferros Republic. Despite the seemingly serious nature of this title, it simply refers to any elf that leaves Galaderyn, or gave up allegiance, for any unofficial reason. Given that it is very difficult for anyone to enter or leave the Republic, the title is quite fitting, as drifting elves have no place or purpose in the Republic's society. The sovereign elves don't necessarily keep track of who is a drifting elf, but guards at the gate will turn away any elf that tries to re-enter Galaderyn without official authority of the sovereign elves.

## Illusionists (Gensōsenshi)

### Background

The illusionists are one of two factions of akumaros descended from the protean concept, [[Protean Concepts#The Reflection|the Reflection]].

## Luxori Covenant

### Background

The Luxori Covenant is a widely-known religious group that worships the Creator.

## Monarchy of Stalwryn
