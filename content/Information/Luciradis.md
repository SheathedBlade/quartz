## Etymology

Luciradis roughly translates to *"shining root"* in ancient tongues, which references back to the creation of this world.

## System of Time

All beings of Luciradis currently follow a system of time concocted by the joint efforts of the respective first Avatars of the Protean Concepts: [[Protean Concepts#The Convergence|the Convergence]] and [[Protean Concepts#The Matrix|the Matrix]]. 

Dates are written as such: N-th Day of the Concept, from the Year X (BSC/ASC), where *N* represents the numbered day within the Concept's month, and *X* represents the specified year. *BSC* is the shorthand for *"Before Scarring"*, and *ASC* is the shorthand for *"After Scarring"*.

> *// K.M. edit //*  
> Since the Cicatri emigration, the world's population have moved to a simpler version of the previous dating system:
> 
> Concept's N-th, XXXX (BSC/ASC)
> 
> This denomination greatly reduced the wordiness of the previous denomination, while fully retaining the information of the original. Dates using the original wording are likely from before the rapid development of Nova Ciel.


## System of Magic

All conventional magic draw power from the foundations of Luciradis, which we refer to as *roots*. There are many such roots, but there are only X roots that all magic originates from:

### Root of Earth

### Root of Water

### Root of Fire
