**The Protean Concepts** are figures from legend, and their influence still grips the world to this day. They are aptly named for their ability to manifest their power within the beings of Luciradis. Each manifestation is different among vessels of power based on their perception of the general concept of its power.

> As an example, the concept of a seer can mean various things. If the vessel is a warrior or predator, the concept manifests itself as imminent foresight, while in invokers, the concept manifests as the traditional far-seeing glimpse into the future.

Once mortal, the Concepts vied for power and domination over the world, razing the land and dooming all living beings upon it. This era was only known as **The Scarring**. It is only through the Concept, the Creator, that this everlasting struggle has finally come to an end. In the aftermath, the Creator reduced all the Concepts to their very essence, and split it across the world, hoping that their powers would never be reunited. The Creator, in turn, disappeared from [[Luciradis]] and took the mantle of the gatekeeper of the [[Stairs of Wanderlust]], which is more commonly known as the afterlife.

In modern times, the powers of the Concepts are much more subdued and controlled due to the remnants of the Concepts taking shelter within vessels. These vessels are dubbed the **Avatars**, persons that wield powers equal to the Concept they are associated with. It is for this very reason that the Avatars take the namesake of the Concept itself, due to their proficiency in wielding the corresponding Concept's powers.

> It should be noted that each Avatar can have multiple Concept remnants, but their proficiency in wielding their powers are proportional to the amount of essence that is housed within the Avatar. Therefore, if a being were to appear with greater Concept essence than that of an existing Avatar, that being would be crowned as the new Avatar, while the former Avatar is demoted. The way this is determined is through a medical apparatus commonly found in clinics across Cicatri Ciel.

Mankind, since the rise of Avatars, have carefully monitored and nurtured these would-be warriors, guiding the Concept remnants to very specific, powerful beings. Nowadays, the appearance of an Avatar can be linked to positions of power within a nation, or a beast of legend. Only certain people truly know who some of these Avatars are, as the rest of the world lives in ignorance of its influence, only hearing their deeds through legends. With more people being born into this world, the essence of the concept becomes more diluted, until there comes a new generation that will have no magical capabilities.

Below details all of the twelve known Concepts within this world, and the manifestations of their power.

## The Creator
**Last Known Avatar:** None  

Not much is known about the Creator, save for a few faded texts and legends. The Creator boasted power unlike any other, and as such triumphed over all other Concepts in **The Scarring**.  Its power was as its namesake, the power to create. The contents as to what it creates can only be inferred from the remaining ancient texts, which state that the Creator had wielded immense spiritual power, capable of manifesting objects of power through the conversion of the surrounding spiritual energy. As such, the deaths of many during the Scarring only served to empower the Creator, eventually surpassing the powers of all other Concepts.

The last texts that our scholars have translated dealt with the aftermath of the Scarring and the subsequent disappearance of the Creator. While all the other Concepts were reduced to their very essence, the Creator was kept whole, and moved to becoming the Guardian Gatekeeper of the [[Stairs of Wanderlust]]. As the Guardian, however, its role was to only observe, and so newly-departed souls would never know of its existence.

## The Shimmering Wings
**Previous Avatar:** [[Factions of Luciradis#Brood of Arodraenix|Orsilus of Arodraenix]]  
**Current Avatar:** [[Saria Pulse]]

The Shimmering Wings refer to the ancient dragon of legend, Arodraenix, during **the Scarring**, and is known for its heightened primal senses. The most notable aspect of this is the ability to keenly hear the beats of the heart. In addition to this, the Shimmering Wings is known to effortlessly rally all the beasts of the land and sea to their side. During the Scarring, this power proved very useful in not only the defense of its territory, but also the conquest of lands beyond its own. It's aptly named as such from the vivid drawings from ancient texts, giving the wings a vibrant amethyst color alongside the blindingly white scales of the dragon.

Its descendants bear the power of the Shimmering Wings, giving priority to the [[Factions of Luciradis#Brood of Arodraenix|new breed of dragons]] that emerged unscathed from the Scarring. Therefore, it is highly unlikely, if not impossible, that non-draconic being should be able to have any essence of the Shimmering Wings.

## The Paragon
**Previous Avatar:** [[Leoris Varens]]  
**Current Avatar:** [[Arzen Lynos]]

The Paragon is known for their stalwart protection against the Concepts during the Scarring. It doesn't hesitate to retaliate against those who wrong him for not only its sake, but for the sake of the beings it is protecting. Its manifestation of power is skewed towards the protection and retaliation of others, which can range between powerful offensive magicks to extremely resilient defensive magicks. It is not uncommon for Avatars to be seen using both offensive and defensive magicks, but since the rise of the [[Stalwryn Kingdom]], Avatars are mostly seen with powerful defensive magicks.

When **the Scarring** first began, the Paragon was stationed in a certain strip of land that would later become territory of the Stalwryn Kingdom. Possessing the strength and resilience, alongside the most powerful invocations, the Paragon began their attack on the other Concepts once the Seer had attacked a small village in its vicinity. Much to the dismay of the villagers he was protecting, the Paragon kept moving forward, never looking back to see the destruction it had wrought.

## The Seer
**Previous Avatar:** [[Driardos Malairse]]  
**Current Avatar:** [[Iris Riedel]]

The Seer is known for their foresight and perception into the future. This ability manifests differently in most Avatars, giving each Avatar different time ranges at which the Avatar can peer into the future. It can range from a few seconds to centuries into the future, the former of which is quite useful in combat since it allows the Avatar to quickly read their foe's movements. In all instances, the power only grants the user a glimpse, specific enough to detail what might happen, but vague enough to remove any and all context from that moment.

The Seer holds immense hatred and contempt towards his fellows following the end of **the Scarring**, when the Creator had reduced the Concepts into their very essence. It was then that the Seer peered into the future, and only found itself within the world. Inferring that this meant that the world was to be theirs in the future, every action that the Seer has been taken since then was in service to that future.

## The Stargazer
**Previous Avatar:** Unknown  
**Current Avatar:** [[Amara Illustros|Unknown]]

The Stargazer, as was written in the ancient texts, was notably the most passive of the Concepts. When threatened, it will act out of self-defense, however this is the only known scenario in which we can discern its feats during the Scarring. Instead, most of the texts name the Stargazer aptly for its unending activity of looking skyward. What it thinks about when looking up to the heavens is unknown.

In certain folklores of eld, the Stargazer boasts both incredible and world-defying magic. Depictions of the Stargazer shows that it is capable of a much more primitive version of psychokinesis, which does include telepathy. However, from what we know now of telepathy, it requires a strong bond with the individual it is trying to influence. As such, it can be assumed that its would-be Avatar would be equally as strong, no matter the amount of remnant within the individual. However, even with its overwhelming power, the Stargazer rarely utilized it, according to ancient texts. Even less so, there are very few instances where an Avatar of this Concept has emerged publicly.

## The Lifeline
**Last Known Avatar:** [[Karos Varens]]  

## The Reflection
**Previous Avatar:** Unknown  
**Current Avatar:** [[Erina Hayashi]]  



## The Navigator
**Previous Avatar:** [[Cyrus Orico]]  
**Current Avatar:** [[Rietta Wrynia]]

The first records of the Navigator were discovered through the ramblings of sailors, speaking of a person that could only be described as a natural compass. It was able to guide ships to their destinations without fail, and without duels with the unpleasant seas. Thus, this person was given the title of the Navigator.

The Navigator is most known for their masterful control over elements of nature. In the ancient texts, it is said that the Navigator is directly responsible for the thriving haven of [[Galaderyn]], showering their land with plentiful harvests and rich wildlife. However, during **the Scarring**, the Navigator is known to conjure various natural disasters in the conflict of power. These natural disasters are what led to the isolation of the elves, their race never peeking outside their gates to see the razed land beyond them.

The Navigator's powers all manifest as masteries of separate elements. For example, an Avatar could be capable of only water-bending, while another could be proficient at manipulating the winds. All records of the Navigator's Avatars show that each and every one of these Avatars are of Elven descent, as practiced invokers and manawards from the [[Factions of Luciradis#Ferros Republic|Ferros Republic]] share many similarities with the Navigator.

## The Harvester
**Last Known Avatar:** Unknown  

## The Illuminator
**Previous Avatar:** [[Runo Illustros]]  
**Current Avatar:** [[Varant Illustros]] & [[Altair Illustros]]

## The Matrix
**Current Avatar:** [[Kallie Myrai]]  

The Matrix is a Concept best known for their thirst, and subsequent storage, of knowledge. All that the Matrix interacts with is recorded within their very soul. To that end, all of our current knowledge is thanks to the power of the Matrix, essentially acting as one enormous library, a wellspring of knowledge, so to speak.

## The Convergence
**Last Known Avatar:** Unknown
