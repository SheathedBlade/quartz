## [[Locations/Cicatri Ciel/index|Cicatri Ciel]]

Cicatri Ciel describes the group of landmasses located in the northern hemisphere of Luciradis. Roughly translating to *"Scarred Sky"* in ancient tongues, this name was conceived after the catastrophic event known as *The Scarring*, where a war between god-like beings have sundered the once-whole landmass apart.

## [[Locations/Nova Ciel/index|Nova Ciel]]

Nova Ciel is the name of the group of landmasses in the southern hemisphere. Roughly translating to *"New Sky"*, its people opted to follow the naming convention that the ancestors of *Cicatri Ciel* used, in which it describes the skies above the land following the sentiments of its peoples. The early pioneers of *Cicatri Ciel* fled from the war-torn lands, and arrived on *Nova Ciel* with the intent of starting anew.
