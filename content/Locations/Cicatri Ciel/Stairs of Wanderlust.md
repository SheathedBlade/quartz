*"Souls climb up these sacred steps to meet with the gatekeeper, either to receive the ability to walk once more, or become one with the world."*  
*Excerpt from "The Advent of Ascension", Luxori Covenant*

The Stairs of Wanderlust is a realm separated from the land of the living, and it is of the popular religious belief that this realm is where the souls of the departed must journey in order to reach the cradle of Luciradis. Each soul's journey is different, but all will reach the same destination in the end: the **Tree of Creation**.

The skies of the realm is eternally bright, with white and emerald painting the skies, and iridescent clouds dotting its canvas. The ground cultivates very unique foliage, dyed subtly in a rainbow hue. To carve a path to the Tree of Creation, steps of marble, dyed in gray, form to guide the errant souls to their ultimate destination.

## Etymology

The Stairs of Wanderlust was coined by the popular [[Factions of Luciradis#Luxori Covenant|Luxori Covenant]], a religious group dedicated to *Genesis*, the original Creator, and its teachings. The realm of the afterlife commonly depicted in scripture as a long set of stairs, with the Tree of Creation serving as the destination for departed souls, standing tall at the summit of the highest hill.

Each soul embarks on a journey that reflects the way they had lived in life, and so each soul must travel across the realm reliving each memorable experience engraved upon their very being. One could say the departed gains a sense of wanderlust, a desire to travel within their own experiences one more time. And at the very end of their journey, destiny ultimately decides the fate of their existence.

### Gates of the Creator

A set of golden gates situated in front of the monumental **Tree of Creation**. Here, the souls of the departed wait patiently for the [[Lucien Demeri|Gatekeeper]] to let them through. The Gatekeeper resides in an office building beside the gates, taking note of each soul's life, regrets, and wishes, before sending them on their way. After that, it is up to fate whether these souls are to be reused for reincarnation, combined with others to form new life, or become the lifeforce of the Tree of Creation, keeping the world alive and healthy for the next generation of life to exist upon.

### Tree of Creation

The Tree of Creation stands tall at the center of this mythical realm. Its bark is white, with its cracks emitting an iridescent glow from within. Shimmering, golden leaves form the tree's canopy, and acts as the beacon for the souls of the departed to follow. The tree is the origin of the creation of Luciradis; the very first organism that is said to be formed by *Genesis*, the original Creator. All concepts, physical and mystical, stem from its existence. Its roots form the very foundation of magic, while every leaf represents a life upon Luciradis. Everything in between lays with the branches and bark: the land, the sea, and the skies.
