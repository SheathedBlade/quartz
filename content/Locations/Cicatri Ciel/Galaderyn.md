*"It is as if the trees bowed together, shielding the drifters from the oncoming destruction. It is only under its protection that the drifters would make their first home."*  
*Excerpt from 'Guidance of the Prismaia', Ferros Republic*

In the eastern lands of Cicatri Ciel, located in a prismaia forest opening and on top of a mana-imbued lake, Galaderyn is the largest font of magical energy that is known on Luciradis, and it is where it shelters the majority of the elven population, led by the [[Factions of Luciradis#Ferros Republic|Ferros Republic]]. Galaderyn is the major producer of many magical apparatuses, including the *"Conceptia Metior"*, the medical examination administered to the population of Luciradis for remnants of the Protean Concepts.
## Etymology

Derived from ancient elvish tongues, Galaderyn is a mixture of two terms dating centuries before the emergence of the Protean Concepts. *"Galad"* is loosely translated to *"radiant"*, while *"eryn"* is loosely translated to *"forest"*. The grove's inhabitants combined the two terms into "galaderyn" and produced a more grandiose meaning of the word: *"Nature's Radiance"*. It's radiance comes from the towering [[Catalog of Materials#Prismaia Tree|prismaia trees]]; hints of rainbow and gold dye the leaves, giving the landscape a majestic, fantastical finish.
