*"Where everything starts, and everything ends; It is the genesis of change upon Luciradis."*  
*Excerpt from 'The Musings of Fate', Luxori Covenant*

Lyntoa Village is a small settlement on the outskirts of the [[Port of Anahymn]], under territory of the [[Factions of Luciradis#Monarchy of Stalwryn|Monarchy of Stalwryn]]. The village has close relations to the royalty of Stalwryn, often netting the village numerous benefits and privileges such as access to high-class education, trade agreements, and protection. Due to its relatively remote location on the cliffs by the coastline, it is a great hub for travelers to briefly stop and peddle wares before arriving to the Port of Anahymn.

Though it has a small population, Lyntoa Village is diverse in its population; human inhabitants are the majority, but one can find [[The Inhabitants of Luciradis#Terrakin|terrakin]] inhabitants due to their close proximity to the forests. In the 5282 ASC census of the Stalwryn Kingdom, it notes a family of elves as part of the population; a rarity since elves are uncommon in any place save for the elven capital, [[Galaderyn]].
## Etymology

Lyntoa Village obtained its namesake from one of the first settlers of the village, Diamant Lyntoa. On the 14th Day of the Convergence, from the Year 751 ASC *(14/12/751)*, Lyntoa was the first to perform the contracted ritual that would save the life of Stalwryn Varens, at the cost of his own life. This selfless act resulted in the remembrance of Lyntoa through the naming of the settlement.

### Well of Dreams

The **Well of Dreams** is the ritualistic structure built by its first settlers, as part of a contract with them and Stalwryn Varens, the first King of [[Stalwryn Kingdom|Stalwryn]]. It is used for performing the [[Converging Terminus]] ritual, where the donor must die by throwing themselves into the well. The Well of Dreams would pluck the donor's soul from [[Stairs of Wanderlust|purgatory]] and send it to the receiving end, where the recipient would absorb the soul, curing the *Bloodied Terminus* affliction and granting the recipient the *Gift of the Realm* from the donor.

> *// K.M. edit //*  
> Since the Stargazer's 19th, 5277 ASC, when the Converging Terminus ritual was last performed, the Well of Dreams have since gone unused, in no part due to the **fall of Stalwryn** years later, rendering the structure functionally useless. This is because of the late king of Stalwryn's untimely death, where he had left no children, thus ending the Varens bloodline.

> Though I had thought it a nice piece of history to observe, with events and revelations observed in the **Cerelicia expedition**, the Well had fostered something far sinister than anyone could've imagined. With the conflict resolved, however, the Well has now finally finished its purpose, and now lays in rest as a relic of the Era of Concepts.
