title: Luciradis Knowledge Database
---
As part of the ongoing efforts to maintain the integrity of ancient historical records and the additions of new records for the foreseeable future, the [[Cerelicia]] government has approved Miss [[Kallie Myrai|Kallie Myrai's]] proposal of the publication of all knowledge regarding the world we live in, [[Luciradis]]. We, at [[Oracle's Vision]], hope that everyone across the world can use the Luciradis Knowledge Database for **educational and academic purposes**.

The **Luciradis Knowledge Database** is a repository of information gathered and maintained over the course of thousands of years, courtesy of Miss Myrai. You can view information on various **influential figures**, **famous locales**, **events that shaped the course of history**, and **firsthand accounts** of individuals who have lived to see these events unfold. In addition to this, the Database holds general, but detailed, information regarding the nature and history of Luciradis. Much of this information is carried over by scholars in the past, but their insights still hold true today, even if its relevance to the modern world diminishes with each generation.

It is the Database's goal to publicize newfound information as they are unearthed. As such, some events that are left to speculation will be contextualized via first-hand accounts, stories, and other pieces of ancient media.

> [!info]
> Areas of text that have been denoted via blockquotes are clarifications for concepts that may be confusing to the reader, or updated information to historical records deemed as necessary to include. This information could come from Head Archivist Myrai herself, in which case she will denote her sections with "*// K.M. edit //*".
## Using the Database

Incorporated into this repository is the concept of **links**. Most, if not all, completed entries in this database contain links to other relevant entries. This is to your benefit as the reader, as there will be terms in which you may not understand initially. **Hovering** over these links will generate a small window containing the relevant entry. **Clicking** on the link will bring you to the page of said entry. These links supplement the entry through contextualizing and explaining terms that may seem foreign.

On the bottom-right, you can see the **backlinks** to an entry, which are links to entries that referenced the current entry. For example, the entry containing information on the [[Protean Concepts]] contains a link to the entry of [[Kallie Myrai|Head Archivist Myrai]]. On Miss Myrai's information page, the Protean Concepts entry is denoted as a backlink, since it referenced Miss Myrai's entry. From here, you can view other entries that have referenced Miss Myrai's page.

As a nice little addition, on the top-right, there is a **node graph**. This visualizes how much each entry in the database links with each other. You are able to use the graph and click on the nodes to bring you to the specified entry.

Our most recent first-hand accounts, stories, and media that we publicize will appear on the left-hand side, underneath the **Explorer**.
