description: Once, a wayward family found shelter and solace upon the world's nest of leaves, only to be pulled into unending conflict and strife. The girl seeks freedom from traditions forced upon her by her father, and finds a boy who wished the same. They stayed together, exploring every leaf that grew upon the nest, but the cruel passage of time soon tested the boy's will to live, and became disillusioned with his life. So, until he finds purpose in himself, she will explore, in his stead, past the small nest of leaves, daring to travel beyond the blanket of stars dotting the night sky - to worlds beyond the grasp of the roots of Luciradis.

*Once, a wayward family found shelter and solace upon the world's nest of leaves, only to be pulled into unending conflict and strife.

*So, until he finds purpose in himself, she will explore in his stead. Past the small nest of leaves, she dares to travel beyond the blanket of stars dotting the night sky - to worlds beyond the grasp of the roots of Luciradis.*

"That you would even deign to return here speaks volumes of your arrogance." A voice in the dark makes its presence known the moment I stepped foot into the cavern. *Just as grating as I remember.*

The dragon's abode rises from their slumber, each with their luminous eyes populating the dark cavern. They gaze towards me, the now-returned daughter of the broodmaster.

"I had the mind to come here one last time before I depart," I respond nonchalantly. The voice in the darkness grows quiet, as if contemplating, before igniting the ceiling light fixtures with its breath of flames, illuminating the room with a bright gold hue.

"Leave, brethren. I would speak to my kin in private." The draconic broodmaster's order is simple, and soon, the nest of dragons heed its command and vacated the cavern. I now face the voice's owner, whose blindingly white scales glisten underneath the golden flames.

"It's been a while, Father." I take step forward, the footstep echoing across the room, breaking the awkward silence. "What is it now...three thousand years? You look none worse for wear."

"I see that aging has not affected your constitution, daughter of mine. You're very lucky to have inherited our draconic aging," retorts the elder. "For my part, I can count my lucky stars that I have lived for twenty millennia. It's not long before I return to the earth."

Father sighs, and then inches closer to me and begins to observe me. *Of course, it's the first time he had seen me since I was little.*

"A warrior, of which she spearheaded the mortal regiment of the kingdom of Stalwryn. A worldly traveler, whom hath scoured every corner of this earth. And now..."
Father slowly stops speaking, *clearly in thought.* In his eyes, I spot a hint of sadness permeating from gaze.

"Y-you..." Father pauses, as if he's digging through his memories. "...You take after her. There was never a day that I stopped thinking about your mother."

*W-what...?* My eyes widen, and I slowly turn to face one of the many reflective amber crystals in the cave, scanning my body in the process. *I've never met my mother, and probably never will.*

"...Could you tell me more about her?"

Father casts a hesitant gaze towards me. *Would it bring up bad memories?* I step closer to Father, affirming my resolve.

"It's just that I-I've never really known her, and it seems she sits close to your heart. I was a rebellious child, sure, but I'd be a fool to not learn of my ancestry, of my family history..." I waver, digging my hands into my coat pockets, gauging his expression for any hint of approval, or lack thereof.

"Calm yourself, child. I do not hold any grudges nor feelings of zemblanity," Father reassures me. "It is clear to me that you have changed for the better since your departure from our clan. Thus, it would be remiss of me not to regale you in our history."

Father rises from his perch and starts heading to the entrance of the cave. *Where's he going? Is he taking me somewhere?*

"Come now, Saria. I would speak of this elsewhere. Let us return to where your mother and I first met."
